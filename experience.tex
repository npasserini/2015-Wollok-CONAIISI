\section{Classroom Experience with wollok}
\label{experience}

Since March 2015 Wollok is being used on the Universidad Nacional de San Martín, on Algoritmos 1 subject, where the main purpose is to introduce OOP to students with minimal experience on structure programming.
In this sections we tell our experience using by the first time, this new language to learn OOP concepts.

%Lo simple que les resulto a los chicos trabajar con una IDE
First of all, lets  describe how the introduction of the students to a new IDE was, since we have been using Ozono with the same aim we propose with Wollok. In this case we have to separate students in two groups,  those who have their first experience with the subject, and those who are in their second.
For the first group, we can ensure it is very easy for the them to work inside an IDE, with just two windows where you write code: one to code  objects and classes, and the other to test the objects behavior (the Repl). There is nothing more to explain.

For the second group, the experience is still more exciting, given that, compared with Ozono, now they have just one place to code the object. Just one file. All the object definition is in the same place. At a glance.


%La simple migración de objetos a clases.
Writing the definition of a class is not very different from writing the definition of an object, the difference is in the concept. So, we first explain to them what an object is, we write the definition of it, we see how it work. Once the students are familiar with object and the way they relate with each other, we move to show how to make object using class, so we can build multiple objects, with the same definition, and different state. 

%Los patrones de diseño que aparecieron que son muy modernos, con el uso de objetos. Era muy simple ver que usaban objetos donde antes se usaban value objects.
Some design patterns just appeared. Modeling with design patterns is not part of our subject, we just introduce them to object paradigm. But we've seen how some of them just appeared, resulting very natural for the students. For example, having a single object with some information that more objects needs (Singleton), since all objects are accesible (anyway this subject is on discussions). And any form of polymorphism (Strategy, State, etc), are just relations between objects, and change that relations between polymorphics objects.


%El uso del REPl, aunque era una basura, fue muy bueno y los pibes le sacaron el gusto.
