% Discussion of actual solution \emph{vs.} initial constraints from \ref{sec:problem}. Explain the space of the solution, why we made it this way.
% Evaluation of the solution. How does the solution meet the criteria? Where does it succeed or fails...

A common point of controversy is whether is is worth to create a brand new language and toolset, 
instead of building our pedagogical ideas on top of existing ones, such as Self, Ruby, Smalltalk or even Eiffel.
In our experience, begginning programmers require different features from their working environment that advanced programmers
and the right selection of tools and concepts can produce substantial improvements in the learning process.
Therefore, we believe that the possibility of fine tuning provided by a specialized environment largely pays for the additional effort.
% y que muestran las grandes posibilidades que se dan a partir de esta decisión inicial: imports, tests y manejo de propiedades.

The design of Wollok import system illustrates the kind of decissions we are able to make thanks to having a specialized learning language and toolset.
By \emph{import system} we mean the way that a programming language allows the programmer to refer in one unit of code (for example a file) to program entities defined elsewhere.

\medskip
In many languages, like C or Ruby, the default behavior is that one can only refer to \emph{programming entities} (such as classes, functions, etc) defined in the same 
file\footnote{Even, in many cases, the definition must occur in the file before the usage to be legal.}
These languages usually provide the notion of an \emph{include}, 
which somehow has the effect of copying the contents of the included program file into another one.
The unstructured nature of this reuse mechanism has many drawbacks, 
because it yields a single namespace with the contents of the two or more files, 
without a clear mechanism to deal with name conflicts.
Also, file-based includes often require the programmer to be aware of the organization of the program files in directories in order to properly locate the file to be included.
Certainly we do not desire to confront beginning programmers with this kind of subleties.

Other languages, such as Java or C\# provide a more structured way to handle imports. 
In this case, a \emph{classpath} is defined, which contains all the definitions (\ie classes) in a \emph{project}.
To univocally identify classes, they are organized in \emph{packages} and each class \emph{full name} is the concatenation of the name of the package with the proper name of the class.
By using the full name of the class, it can be referenced from any file in the project.
Also, the \emph{import} directive allows the program to reference the imported class by its simple name (without package).
In this way, name clashes are avoided, at the cost of introducing a new concept: the package.

Although packages are interesting programming entities because they enable programmers to better organise larger programs, 
they are of little use for a beginner, since his programs are not yet big enough to take advantage of dividing them into packages.
Moreover, this model forces the programmer to define each class in a package\footnote{It is a bad programming practice to leave classes in the \emph{root package}.}, 
and therefore the concept of package has to be introduced right in the first lecture, 
incrementing the set of minimal concepts required for the student to grasp in order to build his first program.

\medskip

Wollok's imports try to combine both models in the most suitable way for initial programming students.
On one hand, in the first part of the course, programs fit into one single file. 
Therefore, it is simpler for students if the default scope is only one file, postponing the introduction of more advanced concepts.
With this in mind, we leave aside package definitions; each file automatically introduces a java-like package without an explicit declaration.

% Prototype-based inheritance
One of them is whether the learning experience should provide a way to reuse
code while still in the form of stand-alone objects without classes.
We have detected that in the early stages of the course, before introducing classes or inheritance, 
it is easy to end up in situations in which it is difficult to avoid duplicating code.
Therefore, later versions of Ozono have introduced prototype-based inheritance mechanism, 
similar to that found in Self language\cite{Ungar87self:the, Ungar91organizingprograms}. 

However, practice has shown that introducing this kind of inheritance did not smooth the transition between objects and classes. Actually it made it harder.
% In addition, prototyping is an excellent abstract model for pure object languages, keeping it simple and incredible powerful.
% But there are almost no popular or industrial languages implementing it (besides Javascript which is not exactly as standard Self prototyping). 
Therefore, we decided to cut off any code-reuse mechanism for stand-alone objects.
In this scenario, the first batteries of exercises have to be carefully selected, 
in order to avoid confronting students with problems will not be able to solve gracefully.
% When duplicated code appears as part of the course, it's important to highlight that to students, and delay solving code duplication later with classes. 
% This subject will be analysed later when we can have results of the application of this approach instead of the one of Ozono.

\medskip 
% Visual tools
\np{Creo que este párrafo no debería ir en discussion}
Another interesting point of discussion is the way to integrate a visual tools to improve the understanding of the program. 
There are many different solutions to this problem. 
One approach used by several tools, like BlueJ \cite{bennedsen_bluej_2010} involves strict UML as a diagram format for showing the information.
We think that this decision is not the best option, because UML includes a lot of information which not always is relevant for an inexperienced programmer. 
We are exploring the idea to have custom diagram formats only showing information that is relevant to the teaching process. 
Furthermore, we are analysing the possibility of adding more attractive diagrams, like board games, or adding custom images and animations to objects.
Allowing the creation of basic board games, and presenting the information in a more attractive way. 
This idea is explored in Gobstones \cite{lopez_nombre_2012} but with a fixed board.

\medskip
Regarding the language grammar and syntax we have at least two points that need to be discussed. 
% Special syntax for property access
One is whether Wollok should introduce alternative
advanced syntax for several constructions like property access, or message
sending. The objective of this alternative syntax would be to reduce the amount
of code and syntax elements (\eg parenthesis, dot for sending messages, or calling getters and
setters). Modern languages such as Scala\cite{Oder04a} and
XTend \footnote{http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/} provide such syntactic sugar.
However, we need to be careful because this shouldn't confuse novice programmers.

% Type annotations
The second point regarding syntax (and actually the whole language) is whether
the language should support some kind of type-level programming. Starting from
type annotations (to fix types for example for parameters, or variables), but
also type aliases, which could come handy given the fact that Wollok has
structural-types. This of course would be an advance topic for the course.
Probably the last topic. Again this concern shouldn't confuse the student all
over the course until reached the point where types are introduced.

\np{Si hacemos una versión larga tenemos que extender esto.}
% Syntax based
Finally, an important design issue addressed by Wollok is the use of text files instead of image
based as a way of storing the programs. This decision was taken with the objective of ease the 
process of switching to an industrial language, as most of them use this way. 
This also allows the use of industrial tools like Version Control Systems, collaborative tools 
and code revisions.
